This is the website of the Mental Health Awareness Organization. It is designed to be responsive on a variety of devices and accessible from different web browsers, including Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, Opera, and Microsoft 
Edge. 

The main priorities for this website were ease-of-access and ease-of-use for different potential viewers, whether their intentions are to simply discover the area of mental health and its ramifications upon the general population, 
how to help themselves if they are struggling with mental health problems, how to help others if they know someone who is struggling with these problems, or if they want to spread the word on the importance of mental health in their 
community and help fight mental health stigma alongside our volunteers.
