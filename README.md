The main priorities for this website were ease-of-access and ease-of-use for different potential viewers. Consistent front-end design was used throughout the entirety of the site, including the same font for different web browsers and 
devices, interchangeable colors for the background and foreground, uniform font-sizes, margins, and paddings for different elements, and easy-to-read layouts with supporting headers, images, links, and even videos and articles to create 
an enjoyable and straightforward user experience. We found simplicity to be the key in providing a well-structured layout that has great responsivity on different devices. 

The website was built for all kinds of users. Whether their intentions are to simply discover the area of mental health and its ramifications upon the general population, gain insight on how to help themselves if they are struggling with 
mental health problems, understand how they can help others if they know someone who is struggling with these problems, or find ways to spread the word on the importance of mental health in their community, they will be able to find what 
they are looking for and more in this multipurpose website. In general, the users will be left gratified and their demands and expectations fulfilled. 

This site serves multiple real-world applications. Since mental health still carries a lot of stigma in the modern world, it is difficult to find a single platform that offers educational value for people who have never faced or even heard 
about some of these issue and at the same time offers practical help for the ones who have a great deal of experience with such problems and are looking for ways on resolving them. Usually, web users have to access and move across different 
sites in order to learn about these issues and find ways on dealing with them. Therefore the goal for this project was to create a single website where users with different needs and aims can retrieve information without having to sift 
through multiple webpages and can find these bits of information wiith ease without our website. 

The website was built using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap v4.5. Git software was used for version control and Github was used for task management and continuous integration. Each individual feature and fix was documented through the use of 
commit-messages. The website was deployed on Github pages.
