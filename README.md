# <div align="center">Mental Health Awareness Organization Website</div>

[View the live project here.](https://madyark.github.io/MS1-project/ "MHA Organization website")

This is the website of the Mental Health Awareness Organization. It is designed to be responsive on a variety of devices and accessible from different web browsers, providing ease-of-use to 
potential viewers who wish to learn about mental health, help themselves in their mental struggles, help others who face mental struggles, or support campaigns promoting mental health 
awareness.

The goal for this project was to create a single website where users with different needs can retrieve information on mental health without having to sift through multiple webpages. 

Right now, it is difficult to find a single platform that offers educational value for people who have never faced or even heard about these issues and at the same time offers practical help for the ones who have a great deal of experience 
with such problems and are looking for ways on resolving them. 

Since mental health issues are exceptionally prevalent in modern society, and since stigma leaves the victims of mental illnesses belittled, misinformed, and uneducated, we attempted to create a website within which users can access resources 
to educate themselves, help themselves, help others, and spread awareness on mental health.  

On our website, users can easily navigate across different pages to find the information that they are looking for depending on their interests within the area of mental health and mental health awareness.

- ### Design

    - #### Color Scheme

        1. The three main colors used are dark-orange, white, and black. They were used interchangeably as background and foreground colors. 

        2. An orange-red color was used for hovering on active navigation menu elements to provide a more enjoyable user experience.

        3. A dark-blue color was used for displaying links in the 'International Suicide Hotline Numbers' section of the 'Help Yourself' page to draw attention to the user by having a conventional appearance of a web-link.

        4. A light-blue color was used underneath the 'External Links' section of the 'Help Yourself' page to convey greater emphasis on the links.

        5. A gray color was used as the background-color for the 'Mental Health Awareness Newsletter' and 'Mental Health Emergency' sections of the 'Home' page to create a contrast between these sections and the sections that precede them. 

    - #### Typography

        1. The Lato font is the main font used throughout the website with Sans-Serif set as the fallback font if for any reason the Lato font does not render correctly. Lato is considered to be a very professional font that is 
        suitable for both titles and body text.

    - #### Images, Videos, and Other Forms of Media

        1. The images used in this website are always in the foreground, without any text interfering with their appearance. Most of the images have rounded corners to provide them with greater aesthetic appearances. 
        
            The images ensure that the viewer gets a pleasurable experience when scrolling through page contents, rather than having to sift through large pieces of text. They also allow the viewer to gain perspective into what is 
            the context behind different pieces of text. 

            Most of the images appear in .jpg or .png formats, however there are a couple that appear in the .webp format which allows for better compression. 
            
            The global support for .webp is now around 90% and rising, yet there are still [some browsers](https://caniuse.com/webp "Chart showing specific browser versions' support status for .webp files") with versions that do not 
            support .webp, which is why we used .png as a fallback for those particular images.
        
             All of the images are responsive. 

        2. The videos used in this website solely appear in the 'Help Yourself' page of the website. They also have rounded corners for greater aesthetic appearances. 
        
            The videos are inserted as iframe elements of youtube links, and they allow the viewer to decide when to press play and when to press stop. Autoplay is turned off as the website allows the viewer to initiate and control such actions.
            
            All of the videos are responsive. 

        3. An article appears in the 'Help Yourself' page of the website. It also has rounded corners and is also inserted as an iframe element. 
        
            The article is hidden on mobile and tablet devices as the small device screen size makes the iframe difficult to operate. 
            
            The article is responsive.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

1. [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)

2. [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

### Frameworks, Libraries, & Programs Used

1. [Bootstrap 4.5.3:](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/)

    - Bootstrap was used to assist with the navigation bar and its responsiveness on all pages.

2. [Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/)

    - Google Fonts was used to download the 'Lato' font, which was the only font used on all pages.

3. [Font Awesome:](https://fontawesome.com/)

    - Font Awesome was used to download icons for aesthetic purposes and UX. Font Awesome icons were used in the header, footer, and all of the textual-links on all pages.

    - The HTML for all of the Font Awesome icons had to use `<i class="fa">` instead of `<i class="fas">`. The icons would not display themselves when using `<i class="fas">` since Font Awesome version 4 kit was downloaded, not version 5.

4. [Git:](https://git-scm.com/)

    - Git was used for version control through the use of the Gitpod terminal to commit the changed code to Git and push it to Github.

    - Git was especially useful for accessing the code that was previously (intentionally or unintentionally) removed or modified and for adding it back in its original form to the HTML or CSS files.  

5. [Github:](https://github.com/)

    - Github was used for storing the code of the website and accessing it later for future alterations.

    - Github Pages were used to deploy the project, to access the project from various devices, and to share it with friends and family members. 

6. [Gitpod:](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/)

    - Gitpod was used to write all of the code, commit and push changes in the terminal, upload files, create the directory structure of the website, and to write the README.md file.

7. [Favicon:](http://www.prodraw.net/favicon/index.php)

    - Prodraw.net was used to create the favicon which appears on the webpage tab on some browsers. 
    
    - The image used is the [logo of the organization](assets/images/hugging.png), which appears at the very left of the navigation bar on every page. 

8. [Wireframe.cc:](https://wireframe.cc/)

    - Wireframe.cc was used to create the [wireframe](wireframes/MS1-wireframes.pdf) for this project. 

    - Wireframe.cc offered a free-trial that unfortunately ended before all of the wireframe pages had been developed. 
        
        Therefore, the wireframe stops in the middle of the 'Spread the Word' page and lacks content for the 'Sign In' and 'Sign Up' pages. There is also no content for the mobile and tablet responsiveness. 

    - The wireframe created is very high-fidelity, meaning it incorporates high levels of detail. 
    
        This has slowed down the process of drafting the wireframes, but also allowed for a quicker development process as the textual content was simply copy-pasted from the wireframes into the HTML.

        This, in turn, led to a greater prioritization of the HTML page structure, CSS stylings, and the media that was to be hand-picked and used throughout the website. 

## Testing

The W3C Markup Validation Service and the W3C CSS Validation Service were used to validate all of the HTML files and the CSS file, respectively, to ensure that all of the codes used were appropriate and had the correct syntax.

- [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) 

### Testing User Stories from the User Experience (UX) Section

- #### Visitor with No Prior Mental Health Knowledge \- Goals

    1. I want to learn more on mental health and its ramifications upon the general population.

        1. Upon entering the site, the user is greeted with a clean and readable navigation bar where they can find the link to the page titled 'Educate Yourself' (the first link in the middle), which will take them to that exact page whose 
            content is self-revealing from the title.

        1. Upon entering the site, the user will also find a large body of text below the navigation bar, which consists of four different headers that read 'Mental Health', 'What is it?', 'How can you help yourself?', and 'How can you help 
            others?'. If the user decides to hover over the latter three headers, they will see that these headers serve as links to supplemental pages as they change their color from black to orange and the cursor changes from a text-cursor 
            to a pointer-cursor. A user with no prior knowledge on mental health will most likely press on the 'What is it?' header which will also take them to the 'Educate Yourself' page.  
        
        1. Inside of the 'Educate Yourself' page, the user can find general information about what mental health is, different figures regarding mental health and mental health issues, and various extracts from personal anecdotes of the 
            people who have struggled or are still struggling with mental issues.

    2. I want to read some of the stories of people who suffer from mental health problems to further my understanding of its effect on people's daily lives.

        2. 

    3. I want to easily navigate around the website to find different bits of information on mental health.

## Credits

The main priorities for this website were ease-of-access and ease-of-use for different potential viewers. Consistent front-end design was used throughout the entirety of the site, including the same font for different web browsers and 
devices, interchangeable colors for the background and foreground, uniform font-sizes, margins, and paddings for different elements, and easy-to-read layouts with supporting headers, images, links, and even videos and articles to create 
an enjoyable and straightforward user experience. We found simplicity to be the key in providing a well-structured layout that has great responsivity on different devices.
